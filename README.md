### How to work with slate for Shopify:

- rename .env-sample to .env and setup your development store config.

- run: `$ yarn start`
- slate will open your localhost, just ignore that, and go to your development store. 
- In the development store you should have your theme loaded
- Changes will hot reload in the dev store.
